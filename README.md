Admin website

This application lets you manage a database of contacts and handle user accounts with different permission levels. Staff members can add and delete contacts, while administrators have additional options to manage other admin accounts. Everything is secured with password hashing and session-based validation.

You can find this project in
`NewAssignments/Assigment12`
